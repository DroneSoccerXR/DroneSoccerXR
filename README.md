  - Train on Drone Soccer with XR Oculus and Lynx Mini Games.
  - Train on virtual drone to switch on real drone when you feel ready
  - Train your drone skills on small XR games
- Developer
  - Learn C# or LUA by creating the AI of drones in a Drone Soccer game.
    - Have the ability to try your code on real drone at th end of the workshop. 
  - Learn to create Drone mini game in small area < 7x7 meters
- Drone fan that don't own a drone.
  - This project aim to a have "drone simulation" for VR/AR headset.
  - We would love to have a live stream room where viewers on Twitch can interact with real drone
    - With small script, chat commmands or sometime remote network full control of the drone(s)
- Assets seeker

## 👋 Hi, Context ?

We are Éloi and Johan.   
He, Johan, love drone, teaching and VR.  
I, Eloi, love code, teaching and XR.  

After a talk about creating an application on the Lynx R1, Johan explained me that he is working on the creation of a community around Drone Soccer.  
I know nothing about drone but the challenge of creating a eSport game on Lynx-R1 that we could create around virtual pratice to real world application triggered my curiosity.  
You can find in this GitHub account our collaboration on this goal.  

> I am usually a 100% free and opensource creator under Beerware license.
> But as it is a collaboration that implies a group of people.
> No license are apply here yet, so no authorization is given unless you contact Johan directly

Most of the repository here are going to be code to use in Unity with in direct link to Drone Soccer.  
We could do plenty of other drone topic, but to avoid spreading around and never finish this project, it is going to be mainly Drone Soccer.  

We hope you enjoy.
