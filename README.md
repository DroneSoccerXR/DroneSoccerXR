## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Context ðŸ¤” ?

We are Ã‰loi and Johan.   
I, Eloi, love code, teaching and XR.  
He, Johan, love drone, teaching and VR.  

After a talk about creating an application on the Lynx R1, Johan explained me that he is working on the creation of a community around Drone Soccer.  
I know nothing about drone but the challenge of creating a eSport game on Lynx-R1 that we could create around virtual pratice to real world application triggered my curiosity.  
You can find he our collaboration on this goal.  

Most of the repository here are going to be code to use in Unity with in direct link to Drone Soccer.  
We could do plenty of other drone topic, but to avoid spreading around and never finish this project, it is going to be mainly Drone Soccer.  

We hope you enjoy.
